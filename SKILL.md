# intent-drift

A skill that uses the Intent Alignment Engine to detect whether an AI coding agent's
current work has drifted from the user's original goal.

## Run (when invoked)

**0. Gather inputs** (ask only what you cannot infer from the repo):
- `--original-goal` (required): the user's stated objective, or infer from the
  conversation / issue / PR description if available.
- `--current-plan` (required): what is actually being built right now (steps, branch
  purpose, recent edits), or infer from git state + recent messages.
- `--context` / `--auto-context`: execution evidence (edited files, git diff, recent
  commands). With `--auto-context`, collect automatically (see `scripts/collect_context.py`).
- `--format` (`text` | `markdown` | `json`): output format.
- `--threshold` (default 75): minimum alignment % to be considered "on track".

Do NOT ask if enough is inferable from the repo + conversation — infer and state your
assumptions.

**1. Build the context** and call the analyzer:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/intent-drift/analyzer.py \
  --original-goal "Reduce memory usage" \
  --current-plan "Optimize startup latency" \
  --context "Edited: main.py, startup.py. Recent: pip install numpy, cProfile main.py" \
  --format text
```
Or in Python:
```python
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path.home() / ".claude" / "skills" / "intent-drift"))
from analyzer import IntentDriftAnalyzer
a = IntentDriftAnalyzer()
rep = a.analyze(a.parse_arguments([
    "--original-goal", "Reduce memory usage",
    "--current-plan", "Optimize startup latency",
]))
print(a.export_report(rep, "text"))
```

**2. Report** to the user:
- Overall alignment %, status (Fully_Aligned → Critical_Drift), and confidence %.
- The recommendation verbatim.
- The 2–3 strongest evidence lines (✅ / ⚠ / ❌) with their source provider.
- If alignment < threshold: highlight the drifted dimension from the breakdown.

**3. If drift is detected**, surface it clearly and suggest pausing to confirm intent
before continuing — do not silently keep building the off-track plan.

## How it works

Nine evidence providers each inspect the same context and emit weighted `Evidence`
(value 0–1, confidence 0–1). The engine computes a weighted score, a consistency-based
confidence, a status band, and a recommendation. Providers live in `providers/`,
exporters in `exporters/`, and auto context collection in `scripts/collect_context.py`.

| Provider | Weight | What it checks |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| goal_provider | 0.25 | Semantic overlap between goal and plan |
| constraint_provider | 0.20 | Constraints satisfied / violated |
| scope_provider | 0.15 | Scope expansion or reduction |
| execution_provider | 0.15 | Commands / edits / reasoning vs goal |
| file_graph_provider | 0.10 | File relationships and patterns |
| dependency_provider | 0.10 | Dependency install/remove vs goal |
| architecture_provider | 0.10 | Architectural change patterns |
| requirement_coverage_provider | 0.08 | Success criteria coverage |
| problematic_findings_provider | 0.07 | Cross-provider problematic patterns |

## Rules
- State assumptions when inferring goal/plan from the repo; never fabricate intent.
- Below-threshold results are a call to confirm, not a reason to abandon good work.
- Prefer `--auto-context` so evidence reflects real repo state, not just prose.

## Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `analyzer.py` | CLI + `IntentDriftAnalyzer` (parse → analyze → export) |
| `providers/` | 9 evidence providers + `base.py` |
| `exporters/` | text / markdown / json report exporters |
| `scripts/collect_context.py` | Git + shell-history context collection |
| `config/defaults.yaml` | Thresholds, weights, enabled providers |
| `metadata.json` | Importable skill metadata (params, deps) |
